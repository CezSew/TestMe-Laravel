# TestMe (with Laravel backend)

## About the project

Simple a-b-c-d question-answer application. I created it to study some cool React mechanisms, and also to make an easy and enjoyable way of studying. 

## What is special about it?

There is an interesting feature- if you make a mistake in two or more questions, they will be repeated to you depending on a pattern:

                        probability = (1 - correct_answers/appearances) * 100%
 
where correct_answers/appearances ratio of 1 is 0% chance of getting the question, and ratio of 3/10 would be 70% chance.

What is really important about the TestMe is the fact, that you can import your own test from .txt file! The pattern of the .txt file should be as follows:

```
question
answer a
answer b
answer c
answer d
```

To specify the correct answers, all you need to do is to put the `+` character as the first char in line of an answer. To make it clear, as an example, if we want to specify that `1.c` and `2.a` are the correct answers, file contents should look like this:

```
question 1
answer a
answer b
+answer c
answer d
question 2
+answer a
answer b
answer c
answer d
```

## Launching and boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
